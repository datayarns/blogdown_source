## Team

Our overall research approach is informed by nuanced views of behaviour and social and organizational change and is responsive to day-to-day demands, and longer-term needs and aspirations of development practitioners their funders, and stakeholders. 

As individuals we are set apart by our respective areas of foundational expertise in information and communication technologies (Evangelia), social psychology (Kavita) and social science methodology (Claudia). We are joined together by a common passion for research design and data science and a firm belief in the transformational power of data and well-designed research. We can be contacted at **infodatayarns@gmail.com** or individually.


**Dr Evangelia Berdou**

[Evangelia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evangeliaberdou/) holds a PhD in Media and Communications from the LSE. She is an expert on the implications of digital platforms for socio-economic and political change, the interplay between offline and online dynamics of inclusion and exclusion and the way in which connectivity is shaped by norms and economic barriers. 

Evangelia has examined these dynamics in the context of open online collaborative communities, in connection to gender and poverty, and more recently as part of efforts to strengthen youth voices and youth’s sexual and reproductive health and rights in conflict and fragile states. She has also conducted research on the role of digital platforms and mobiles to support citizens’ voice and improve public service delivery.  Evangelia has extensive experience in leading multi-country research projects and collaborating with diverse groups of stakeholders, such as software developers to improve the design and delivery of digital services.  Before creating  Data Yarns Research she spent eight years working at the Institute of Development Studies, in the UK. She has led consultancies for the World Bank, UNICEF and DFID.

## Portfolio 

We are interested in and have a track record in developing:

- Digital tools for data gathering (such as mobile phones, social media and chatbots) and their application in field experiments.
- Methodological and analytical frameworks which combine emerging data sources (big data and citizen generated data) with traditional survey data to derive enriched insights on social change.
- The use of digital and traditional media for supporting positive behavioural and social change.
- Research designs for triangulating large-scale quantitative and ethnographic research (observations, focus and individual interviews) to deepen learning.
- Approaches for monitoring and evaluation that combine routinely collected administrative information with well-targeted primary data collection. 
- Advancing the discussion and practice around on data ethics, security and privacy through the development of specific solutions.
