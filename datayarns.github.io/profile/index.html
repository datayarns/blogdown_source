<p>Our overall research approach is informed by nuanced views of behaviour and social and organizational change and is responsive to day-to-day demands, and longer-term needs and aspirations of development practitioners their funders, and stakeholders.</p>

<p>As individuals we are set apart by our respective areas of foundational expertise in information and communication technologies (Evangelia), social psychology (Kavita) and social science methodology (Claudia). We are joined together by a common passion for research design and data science and a firm belief on the potential for the transformational potential of data and well-designed research. We can be contacted at <strong>infodatayarns@gmail.com</strong> or individually.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Evangelia Berdou</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evangeliaberdou/" target="_blank">Evangelia</a> holds a PhD in Media and Communications from the LSE. She is an expert on the implications of digital platforms for socio-economic and political change, the interplay between offline and online dynamics of inclusion and exclusion and the way in which connectivity is shaped by norms and economic barriers.</p>

<p>Evangelia has examined these dynamics in the context of open online collaborative communities, in connection to gender and poverty, and more recently as part of efforts to strengthen youth voices and youth’s sexual and reproductive health and rights in conflict and fragile states. She has also conducted research on the role of digital platforms and mobiles to support citizens’ voice and improve public service delivery.  Evangelia has extensive experience in leading multi-country research projects and collaborating with diverse groups of stakeholders, such as software developers to improve the design and delivery of digital services.  Before creating  Data Yarns Research she spent eight years working at the Institute of Development Studies, in the UK. She has led consultancies for the World Bank, UNICEF and DFID.</p>

<p>Evangelia can be contacted at: <strong>evangeliaberdou@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

She continues to hold a Visiting Fellowship in the Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science. Her primary expertise lies in evidence creation around media-enabled social and behavioural change. She has led the evaluation of multi-country, longitudinal projects aimed at shifting norms in health, governance and humanitarian resilience. She is the CEO and founder of <a href="https://simplicityconsulting.co.uk" target="_blank">Simplicity</a>, a consultancy with partners in Zimbabwe, India and South Africa focused on social impact. Simplicity works across the public and private sectors in communications, cultural education, race, gender, and evaluation.</p>

<p>Prior to founding Simplicity, Kavita was BBC Director, Research and Learning for 8 years where she managed research and evidence with a team of 100 researchers in 28 countries. Over the last 10 years she has been leading a seminar series which seeks to bridge theory and practice in collaboration with the LSE&rsquo;s Department of Psychological and Behavioural Sciences. In 2017, she founded the <a href="https://simplicityconsulting.co.uk/msn-collaborator" target="_blank">Media Social Norms Collaborator</a>, a space seeking to support more relevant research and impactful interventions by facilitating exchanges between scientists and practitioners.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>

<p>We are interested in and have a track record in developing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital tools for data gathering (such as mobile phones, social media and chatbots) and their application in field experiments.</li>
<li>Methodological and analytical frameworks which combine emerging data sources (big data and citizen generated data) with traditional survey data to derive enriched insights on social change.</li>
<li>The use of digital and traditional media for supporting positive behavioural and social change.</li>
<li>Research designs for triangulating large-scale quantitative and ethnographic research (observations, focus and individual interviews) to deepen learning.</li>
<li>Approaches for monitoring and evaluation that combine routinely collected administrative information with well-targeted primary data collection.</li>
<li>Advancing the discussion and practice around on data ethics, security and privacy through the development of specific solutions.</li>
